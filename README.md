The video created by a surveillance cameras plays a crucial role in crime prevention and examinations  in smart cities. The closed-circuit television camera (CCTV) is essential for a range of public uses in a smart city; combined with Internet of Things (IoT) technologies theycan turn into smart sensors that  help to ensure safety and security. However, the authenticity of the camera itself raises issues of building up integrity and suitability of data. In this paper,we present a blockchain-based system to guarantee  the trustworthiness of the stored recordings,allowing authorities to validate whether or not a video has  been altered. It helps to discriminate fake videos from original ones and to make sure that surveillance  cameras are authentic. Since the distributed ledger of the blockchain records the metadata of the CCTV video as well, it is obstructing the chance of forgery of the data. This immutable ledger diminishes the  risk of copyright encroachment for law enforcement agencies and clients users by securing possession  and identity...
